One of the first things I learned when I started asking questions about political organizing is the importance of the local Precinct Committee. It's the reason one of our core strategies is getting more people to run for this small but mighty office.

So what is the Precinct Committee? Let me start a few steps back from there. You know how when you go to vote, you have to find your polling place? That polling place is where everyone in your precinct goes to vote. Belvidere and greater Boone County are divided up into many voting precincts - and you always cast your vote at the polling place for your precinct.

As the two dominant political parties in our country, the Democrats and the Republicans each form a Precinct Committee consisting of a representative of each precinct in the county. Voting on candidates for these committees is done at primary elections since in Illinois (for better or worse... I think worse... but that's another post) you may cast a primary ballot as either a Democrat or Republican. It's a convenient time to divide us up and make us choose who will represent our neighborhood (aka precinct) to our preferred party.

Here's where you come in. Running for Precinct Committeeperson as a Democrat in Belvidere or Boone County does not require a ton of effort on your part but yields tremendous returns when it comes to shaping the outcomes of future elections as well as the direction of the local Democratic Party.

Let me start with the latter: the Precinct Committee shapes the direction of the local Democratic Party. I'm not going to lie, when I got started with this work I was dead set against getting involved with the Boone County Democrats because they didn't represent my Progressive values. Luckily a good friend named Freddy convinced me that if we get organized, even just a little, we could change the course of our local Democratic Party to meet the needs of our changing community and country.

According to the laws of the state of Illinois, those elected to the Precinct Committee control the Boone County Democratic Central Committee. To put it simply: the more progressives we elect to the Precinct Committee, the more progressive the Boone County Democrats become.

Now - let's talk about how the Precinct Committee helps shape the outcomes of future elections. This is my favorite thing about Precinct Committee. As Precinct Committeeperson you represent your neighborhood. You have the opportunity to get to know your neighbors and encourage them to vote. You get access to resources which will help you identify like-minded individuals in your neighborhood. You can cultivate a progressive movement at the very grass-est of grassroots levels.

Then as we recruit a growing number of progressives to run for City Council, County Board, School Board, etc. you can rally your neighbors to vote - and win. Did you know that most local elections are determined by less than 100 votes? A little bit of organizing on our part goes a long way.

So that's it. We want you to run for Precinct Committee in your neighborhood. You can do it. We can help. Your participation in this small but mighty office provides the most bang for your buck in terms of effort vs. reward, and it's essential to our strategy of electing local progressives and turning Boone County blue.
