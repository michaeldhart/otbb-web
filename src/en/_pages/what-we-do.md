In the broadest sense, the mission of OTBB is to elect progressives to office in Belvidere and Boone County. In order to accomplish this, we work at two main tasks: mobilizing voters and recruiting progressives to run for office.

# Mobilizing Voters

Simply put - we cant make change if we don't vote into office people who share our views. To this point you may say, "Yeah but why would I vote when there is no one on the ballot that shares my views?" - and you would be correct. See below for how we want to change that.

OTBB works to get out the vote in every neighborhood in Belvidere and Boone County. We do so by equipping people in each precinct with the training and materials they need to encourage their neighbors to get out and vote.

# Recruiting Progressives to Run for Office

This is the fun part. Decisions are made every day in our community, decisions that impact the lives of citizens, business owners, employees, and students. Who makes those decisions? Currently in Belvidere and Boone County there are 22 county board and city council seats. 95% of current occupants are white, 72% are male. In order to provide more accurate representation of our community, we need more people to run for office!

Who can run for office? You can! We really want to encourage you (yes you!) to consider running for Precinct Committe, School Board, County Board, and City Council. What's more, we can help. If you're considering running to represent progressive values in our community, we will help you along the way.
