title: 'Who We Are'
---

Operation Turn Boone Blue is a growing group of left-leaning residents of Belvidere and Boone County who started to organize in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the pandemic hindered our early efforts we continue to believe that there is a significant (and growing) population of like-minded locals in Boone County, and that if we organize we can change public policy and improve the lives of the people in our community.

**Do you want to be a part of this with us?** We believe in recruiting as many progressive voices as possible to magnify our efforts. If you care about progressive values like health care, the environment, gender equality, LGBTQIA+ rights in your community, we want you to be a part of the movement!

# Founding Members

## Freddy De La Trinidad

## Michael Hart

Michael was born and raised in Belvidere, graduating from BHS in 1998. He attended Illinois Wesleyan University where he completed a degree in Music Education. From there, he and his wife Lauren moved to New York City where they lived for 6 years working in the nonprofit sector; eventually starting their own NPO which taught music, drama, art, dance, and ESL in East Harlem, NYC.

Improbably enough they ended up back in Belvidere where they have been since 2010. Michael credits his experiences in New York for granting him the perspective which fuels his activism today. He is now a Software Engineer and proud father of three girls, two dogs, and one cat.
